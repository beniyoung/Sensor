COSC2325 002
GROUP2 ALPHA TEAM


The overall goal is to get reading from DHT11 sensor and have the data send to either the LCD or USART.
Most of the files uploaded is what I've had on my computer, and decided to put in this public repository
for now. When I have access to the Group2 repository, I will upload. This part that I'm working has been solo
because of not having access to the group repository, so I have some stuff already done but dont have commits
attached to them yet. Which is why i started this repo since trying to go back to working versions is hard
without it :)

The COM port needs to be set in Makefile

Command for Windows 10:

mingw32-make

mingw32-make load
